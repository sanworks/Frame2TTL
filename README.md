# Frame2TTL
Hardware and software to capture discrete pixel intensity transitions from a small patch of an LCD screen. Transitions are reported as 5V TTL pulses. This device is used to provide ground-truth measurements of frame onset times in visual stimulus presentation (e.g. with PsychToolbox; http://psychtoolbox.org/ ).
