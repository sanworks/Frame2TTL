Build notes:

F2TTL_v3_PrintedParts_r1_0 and
F2TTL_v3_PrintedParts_r1_0_PressFitSensor
are designed for 3D-printing on an FDM machine.

In the PressFitSensor version, the sensor connects to the side mount arm with a loose friction fit instead of with tab locking, allowing it to be removed after assembly.

Material: Ultimaker CPE, ColorFabb XT or equivalent
Material color: Black
Nozzle width: 0.4mm
Ultimaker printer recommended. Use slicer settings from included Cura profile.

F2TTL_v3 contains 4 parts to print, and 1 model of the circuit board (colored black). Part names are noted in the design file.

Assembly notes:
-The PCB mount holds the sensor PCB. Press the PCB bottom into the bottom of the mount and bend the mount slightly until the PCB presses under the retaining edges. The PCB will be secure when the mount relaxes.

-The PCB mount snaps into the side arm with moderate pressure. Orient the PCB mount so that the sensor faces towards the arm.

-The rear arm has a socket for a captured nut and thumb screw. The rectangular extension of the side arm fits into the rectangular hole in the rear arm. The initial fit may be tight. Force the rear arm back and forth along the side arm ~20 times to achieve a good fit.

-The foot connects to the rear arm with the dowel pin. Align the holes and press the dowel pin from above until it mates with the narrow hole on the opposite side, securing the foot in place.
